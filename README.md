Module 6

Mohammed from AskBCS Learning was incredibly helpful in providing me with syntax help when it came to identifying nearest city for each lat, long combinations in WeatherPy Cell 66. He also helped a lot with Defining the function to create Linear Regression plots in cell 79. Also reviewing previous material in the zoom recordings from week 6 were also super useful in completeing both WeatherPy and VacationPy.
