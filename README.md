Module 6

Mohammed from AskBCS Learning was incredibly helpful in providing me solutions to my syntax questions regarding these two tasks that I had trouble with: "Identifying nearest city for each lat, long combinations" in Cell 66 and "Defining the function to create Linear Regression plots" in cell 79 for WeatherPy. Reviewing previous material in the zoom recordings from week 6 were also super useful in completeing both WeatherPy and VacationPy.
